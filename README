Starting the server
===================

This is a shortly explanation. See docs/tutorial.html for more
information.

If you don't have a perl interpreter yet, install it first. You can
download it from http://www.cpan.org/ports/ .

Windows Users:

Just unzip the archive and double-click the pts.pl icon (you must
install perl interpreter before).

UNIX Users:

1. tar xzf pts-*.tar.gz
2. cd pts-*
3. ./pts.pl &

If you want to run pts process as a daemon, set constant DAEMON (in the
pts.pl) to 1 and type just `./pts.pl'.

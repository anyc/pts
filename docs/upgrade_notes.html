<H1>Upgrade Notes</H1>

<H2>Upgrading v0.19 to v0.20</H2>
<P>Added ability to detect cheat programs such as TClone.

<P>Japanese system message file is no longer loaded in default.</P>

not his/her real nickname which is visible for players.
Remember this if you are using profile and ban functions.</P>

<P>Added Report system, which consists of two part.
The one is existing logging system,
and the other one is reporting online players with a certain authority.

Additionally, some logging (now known as report) messages have been changed.</P>
<P>Added [Main] ReservedName to config file. Users cannot use the names for their nickname.</P>

If you changed `en.msg' and/or added a your own command, take care of it.</P>

<H2>Upgrading v0.16 to v0.17</H2>
<P>Now secure file (pts.secure) has a section name [Secure] as the first line.
And message file (msg.en) has [Messages].

<P>You must rewrite pts.ini and pts.secure.
The authority system had changed to 10 levels from 3 levels.
In default, the op (/auth op) is associated to level 5,
the admin (/auth admin), called owner before, is associated to level 9.
Users are 0, and mederators (players who are on slot 1) are 1.</P>

<H2>Upgrading v0.12 to v0.13</H2>
<P>If you want to use pts on unix, you can set DAEMON to 1.
Then type just `pts.pl' to start the server instead of typing `pts.pl &'.</P>
